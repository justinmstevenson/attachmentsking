ADJUST HYDRAULIC PRESSURE
Adjust pressure to your drive unit independently from the parent machine. This allows for maximum torque adjustment of the drive unit and ensures that screw anchors are not subjected to excessive torque resulting in damage or destruction of the screw anchor.
PLUG & PLAY SYSTEM
Pressure gauges are mounted to the valve to monitor pressure. Use on its own, or with your existing drive unit ECV.
